# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables //declarations that are processed before any code is executed. //
	* Strings // stores a series of characters in single quotes. //
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) // a procedure that performs a task or creates a value //
	* `if` statements // The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is      true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. // 
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) // represents one of two values: true or false. //



2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
